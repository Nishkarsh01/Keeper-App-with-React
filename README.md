## What is this app?

Keeper App is an app where we can store our daily thoughts, tasks, lists, etc. This app has been developed using ReactJS. 
Through this app I familiarized myself with its fundamentals like working with components, props, working with hooks, with different states, complex states and managing the component tree.

So in a nutshell I had a lot of fun while working on this project.
